# website-chat-relay
relays chat messages from and to mc servers via mineflayer

messages sent by players are sent to the website, and you can send messages to the minecraft server that it is connected to if you have the auth token which is saved as a cookie :p

this is adapted to work in replit, make sure to set a secret ['auth'] token to be some secret long password
